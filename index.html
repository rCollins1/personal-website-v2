        <p>The wiring on the inside allowed for the arduino to connect to the LED grid, buttons (passcode, lock and unlock), red indicator and the servo motor to open the lock.</p>
        <img class="project-img" src="main/assets/secure-safe/2.jpg">
        <p>A self-created timing function was used to lock out the user if they took too long to enter a code, and would automatically reset the password as needed.</p>
        <img class="project-img" src="main/assets/secure-safe/3.jpg">
        <p>Upon opening, the user would specify which 'slot' was now taken up by an item in the safe, which would toggle that spot of the LED grid and relock the safe.</p>

        <h2>THIS WEBSTE!</h2>
      </header>
      <div class="w3-container">
        <p>This website started as a fun project to do something with my 'rachelyn.com' domain. I quickly realized that it was also a great learning experience in how to go from a conceptual design into something I could show off to employers, friends and family.</p>
        <p>Initially I started out with a bootstrap template, but quickly realized that my creativity felt restricted. The more I edited the template, the more I realized I had ideas that would be better created from scratch.</p>
        <img class="project-img" src="main/assets/figma3.jpg">
        <p>After getting some inspiration for a while, I designed some wireframes using Figma, and then set out creating the website from scratch, importing small open-source libraries as needed.</p>
        <p>The simulated chatbot was a particularly fun secton to implement. I started with several iterations of flowcharts to ensure there would be no loopholes in the conversation. The chat was implemented by dynamically creating each text node through jquery, such that there is nothing but an empty section in the HTML.</p>
        <img class="project-img" src="main/assets/lucidchart.png">
        <p>It seems like every time I implement a feature, I come up with 3 more ideas for future functionality, so I think this prokect may never be 'completed'!</p>

        <h2>INVESTMENT QUIZ GENERATOR</h2>
      </header>
      <div class="w3-container">
        <p>My team and I were provided with an investment quiz created in Java with no documentation and were tasked with recreating it using modern frontend technologies.</p>
        <p>I took the original flash quiz (left), played around with some wireframes (centre) and a couple iterations of design mockups (right) and presented my designs to the rest of the team.</p>

        	<img class="slides" src="main/assets/slide3.png">
        </div>
        <p>The coolest part of the project was how we decided to make the quiz run mainly through a sigular JSON file, containing questions, answers, point values of each question and all of the stock information given by the company.</p>
        <p>This allowed me to go in later using the Cascade CMS and create a template for users from other departments without any coding knowledge (think marketing or studio) to get into the quiz and change data on a regular basis.</p>
        <img class="project-img" src="main/assets/cmstoquiz.png">
        <p>Since the data definition in Cascade exported an unorganized XML file, I used XPath tool extensively to generate and format a JSON file from the inputted content. Taking into account content types and exception cases, I was able to dynamically create a JSON file to work with the quiz template.</p>
